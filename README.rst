Why I Have Forked The Project:

For my purposes I need feedstail to maintain a much larger collection of polled items. I was finding that only after an hour I was starting to see articles I had seen previously. I have added a command line flag, -c, that will allow you to set the size of the cache. I have currently set mine to 800. The original README is included below.

Feedstail
=========

Feedstail is a tail-f-like utility for feeds. It monitor a feed and emits new entries.
Feedstail aim to be simple, hackable and compatible with rsstail_ its C brother.

Feedstail is released under the terms of the `GNU General Public License v3`_ or later.

Get started
-----------

Use pip to install feedstail the easy way:

::

  $ pip install feedstail

Or retrieve the project with git and install it:

::

  $ git clone git://gitorious.org/feedstail/feedstail.git
  $ cd feedstail
  $ python setup.py install

Then, launch feedstail with the `identi.ca`_ feeds to test it:

::

  $ feedstail -u http://identi.ca/api/statuses/public_timeline.atom

.. _identi.ca : http://identi.ca/


Examples
--------

By default, feedstail will checkout the feeds every 15 minutes. If you
want to customize this interval you can use the ``i`` option.
The following example will retrieve feeds every 5 seconds:

::

  $ feedstail -u http://identi.ca/api/statuses/public_timeline.atom -i 5


The default output format may not be ok for you. You can specify your
own format using the ``f`` option. The given fields must be an
available property of the feed entries.
The following example will output the published date, the title and the link:

::

  $ feedstail -u http://identi.ca/api/statuses/public_timeline.atom -f "{published}: {title} - {link}"

This last example use the string formatting syntax appeared in the 2.6
version of Python.
However, feedstail aim to be 2.5 compatible so you can use the old
string formatting syntax:

::

  $ feedstail -u http://identi.ca/api/statuses/public_timeline.atom -f "%(published)s: %(title)s - %(link)s"


Feedstail compares the ``id`` element to find new entries. You can
choose another element of comparison with the ``k`` option.
The following example says to feedstail to use the title to find new
entries:

::

  $ feedstail -u http://identi.ca/api/statuses/public_timeline.atom -i 2 -k title



As feedstail is built above `feedparser`_, the available values of
format fields and keys can be found in `the documentation of the library`_.
